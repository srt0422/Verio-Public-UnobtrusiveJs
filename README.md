Unobtrusive Javascript Library

This is a work in progress, which currently contains one class (coffee/js) that can be exposed to register any custom data attributes with function handlers for simple unobtrusive plugin/app development.  All handlers are stored in a private collection, and are assigned to a specified event when "execute" is called.
